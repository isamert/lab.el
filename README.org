#+TITLE: lab.el

/lab.el/ is an Emacs package that provides a simple integration with GitLab (managed or self-hosted).

* Basics

~lab.el~ is designed to make your /daily/ interactions with GitLab easier. Want to quickly list latest merge requests for a project? You got covered! Want to create a merge request for the project you are currently working on, totally inside Emacs? You got covered! Want every function on GitLab API exposed as an elisp function? You are on your own. See /Functionality summary/ down below for a quick rundown of what ~lab.el~ is capable of.

Workflow is generally ~completing-read~ based. You list and select an item (a project/merge request/pipeline/job) and then you trigger one of the listed actions that can be acted upon selected item. There are also other special interactive functions, like ~lab-create-merge-request~. Also some functions work directly on current project you are working on (provided by ~project.el~).

/lab.el/ also supports [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark][embark]], you can use ~(embark-act)~ on any kind of item and you'll see all possible actions. This is generally useful for doing bulk actions (possibly using ~embark-act-all~) as the primary feature of embark, /listing actions of a target/, is already covered by /lab.el/.

I extracted this package from my ~init.el~ as the feature set grew to a point that is too much to keep it in there. This may explain why some of the functionality that you expect a GitLab client would have is missing. It's because I probably don't use that feature.

* Installation

Just download =lab.el= file and put it into your =load-path=, afterwards you can simply do the following in your =init.el=:

#+begin_src elisp
  (require 'lab)
#+end_src

You can also use =use-package=

#+begin_src elisp
  ;; with straight:
  (use-package lab
    :straight (:host github :repo "isamert/lab.el"))

  ;; with quelpa:
  (use-package lab
    :quelpa (lab :fetcher github :repo "isamert/lab.el"))
#+end_src

* Usage

Set the following variables and you are good to go:

#+begin_src elisp
  ;; Required.
  (setq lab-host "https://gitlab.mycompany.com")

  ;; Required.
  ;; See the following link to learn how you can gather one for yourself:
  ;; https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#create-a-personal-access-token
  (setq lab-token "YOUR-PRIVATE-GITLAB-API-TOKEN")

  ;; Optional, but useful. See the variable documentation.
  (setq lab-group "YOUR-GROUP-ID")
#+end_src

See ~M-x customize-group lab~ for all customization options.

* Functionality summary

Here is a quick rundown of features ~lab.el~ provides:

- Projects ::
  - List projects belonging to you or a group.
  - Act on projects:
    - Open them in browser.
    - Clone single project or do a bulk cloning.
    - List merge requests of given project.
    - Show detailed information about given project.
- Merge Requests ::
  - List merge requests belonging to a group, a branch, a project or all merge requests that you created or assigned to.
  - Act on merge requests:
    - Open them in browser.
    - Mark them as ready or as draft.
    - Rebase remote branch against the target.
    - List pipelines and act on them.
    - Show detailed information about given merge request.
  - Create merge requests with an easy to use merge request wizard. It also let's you edit details of your merge requests in markdown buffer with yaml header and shows you the diff generated by your merge request (using /magit/, if available).
- Pipelines ::
  - List pipelines belonging to a project or a merge request.
  - Act on pipelines:
    - Open them in browser.
    - Trigger retries, cancellation or deletion.
    - Start watching given pipeline in background and get notified if pipeline finishes or requires a manual action.
    - List individual jobs of a pipeline and act on them.
    - Show detailed information about given pipeline.
  - Automatically start watching pipelines after a push and get notified about their status. (See /Extras/tips/ section below)
- Jobs ::
  - List jobs belonging to a pipeline.
  - Show logs of a (latest) failing job in a nicely formatted Emacs buffer.
  - Act on jobs:
    - Open them in browser.
    - Trigger retries, cancellation or deletion.
    - Show logs of a job on a nicely formatted buffer.
    - Show detailed information about given job.

Here are few screenshots to get a feel of what you would see while using ~lab.el~:

By default, actions can be selected using ~read-multiple-choice~. You can change this to a ~completing-read~ based action handler by modifying the ~lab-action-handler~ variable.

Other functions work in similar fashion, where you list something (projects/pipelines/jobs etc.) and act upon them. Here is how you create a merge request:

* Extras/tips

** Supplemental packages

Some packages enhances ~lab.el~ with extra features:

- [[https://github.com/jwiegley/alert][alert]] :: Desktop notifications for ~lab-watch-*~ commands.
- [[https://github.com/jrblevin/markdown-mode][markdown-mode]] :: For better ~lab-create-merge-request~.
- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Version-Control.html][vc]] :: Shows you the diff generated by your merge request while creating a merge request with ~lab-create-merge-request~.
- [[https://github.com/sshaw/git-link][git-link]] :: Open current repository in browser easily. ~lab.el~ does not use this package but it's nice to have if your workflow requires some manual interventions to GitLab UI.

** Start watching your pipeline automatically

- After creating an MR:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (add-hook lab-after-merge-requests-create-functions #'lab-watch-merge-request-last-pipeline)
  #+end_src

- After pushing a commit:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (add-hook YOUR-PUSH-HOOK #'lab-watch-pipeline-for-last-commit)
  #+end_src

- If you are using [[https://github.com/magit/magit][magit]], following advice may be used for triggering pipeline watcher after each push:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (define-advice magit-push-current-to-pushremote (:after (&rest _) start-watching-pipeline)
      (lab-watch-pipeline-for-last-commit))
  #+end_src

- If you are using vc, it would be the following:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (define-advice vc-push (:after (&rest _) start-watching-pipeline)
      (lab-watch-pipeline-for-last-commit))
  #+end_src

** ~project.el~ integration

You can integrate the ~lab.el~ functions you frequently use into ~project.el~, like following:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (define-key project-prefix-map "M" #'lab-list-project-merge-requests)
  (add-to-list 'project-switch-commands `(lab-list-project-merge-requests "List merge requests"))

  (define-key project-prefix-map "P" #'lab-list-project-pipelines)
  (add-to-list 'project-switch-commands `(lab-list-project-pipelines "List pipelines"))
#+end_src

Now ~List pipelines~ and ~List merge requests~ actions will be added to ~project.el~ actions list and you'll be able to access them using ~C-x p M~ and ~C-x p P~ respectively.

* Using as a GitLab API client

You can use the provided ~lab--request~ function write your on [[https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/api_resources.html][GitLab API]] wrappers:

#+begin_src elisp
  ;; Get *all* pipelines currently running on master.
  (lab--request
   "projects/#{project}/pipelines"
   :scope "running"
   :ref "master"
   :%collect-all t)
#+end_src

* Differences & similarities with [[https://github.com/magit/forge][forge]]
Although /lab.el/ and /forge/ have some overlapping features, they can be used together to complement each other. Here is a comment I made earlier when the difference is asked:

#+begin_quote
I don't use forge (tried in the past but not got so far with it), so I cant really give a throughout answer but here is a quick summary as far as I know:

/forge/ does not provide any functionality regarding to
- pipelines
- jobs
- projects (like listing owned/group projects and doing actions on them like cloning, printing detailed info etc.)

Please see README for rundown of operations that you can do with aforementioned features.

/forge/ copies remote information into your local, so you need to sync stuff time to time. /lab.el/ retrieves information on demand. This can be a good or bad thing depending on how your workflow is structured.

/lab.el/ have specialized functions, like ~lab-list-my-merge-requests~ which lists all the merge requests you've opened or assigned to recently. So it is not tied to a single project, you can jump around more easily. There are a few functions like this.

/lab.el/ is structured around ~completing-read~. So there is really so little that you need to learn, just call the function, select something and act on them. No complex buffers.

Most of the time, /lab.el/ provides you an easy way to jump to related GitLab page instead of trying to do things in Emacs. For example, I don't see the point of having merge-request comments inside Emacs without the diff like /forge/ does. So /lab.el/ redirects you to GitLab page where-I think-its better to do. If the thing is easier and beneficial to handle in Emacs, lab.el does that. An example for that would be the ~lab-act-on-last-failed-pipeline-job~ function which shows you the jobs for the latest failed pipeline so that you can act on them (like triggering a retry or dumping the logs into a buffer) right inside Emacs.

/forge/ has a way of dealing with GitLab issues too, /lab.el/ does not provide anything on this end (but merge requests are welcome). /forge/ also handles merge-request comments whereas with lab.el you can only create merge-requests inside Emacs, no comment management. (But as I indicated above, I don't find this feature in /forge/ super useful.)

I believe the overall usage and focus is completely different, you need to check it out to see yourself. I may have misinformation about /forge/ on some topics I listed above, please correct me where I'm wrong.
